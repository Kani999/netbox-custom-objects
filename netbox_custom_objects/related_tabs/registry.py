    ``registry['views']`` at that moment.  Anything added to the registry after the
    URLconf is built has no URL pattern.  Likewise, ``_inject_co_urls()`` mutates
    ``netbox_custom_objects.urls.urlpatterns`` and must run before any URL resolver
    populates its lookup cache against that list.

    Earlier versions deferred typed-tab registration to the first HTTP request
    (commit 5bf09c3, PR #4) to silence DB-access warnings from Django and
    netbox_branching.  That broke typed-tab URL routing entirely — the Add-button
    feature in 2.3.0 was never reachable on a deployment.  See 2.3.0 release notes.
